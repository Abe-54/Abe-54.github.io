      <h2>What is Production?</h2>
      <p>
        Definition: The Production phase of the project is the longest phase of
        developing a game and is when a studio transforms the concepts created
        during pre-production into game assets and source code for video games.
      </p>

    <p>
      Since this phase of production is where the game actually gets made, there
      are a variety of different tasks that need to get done. Below you will
      find different areas of expertise when producing a game.
