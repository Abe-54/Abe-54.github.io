    <h2>Launching the Game</h2>
    <p>
      This is the day everyone is excited about and eagerly waiting for. During
      this phase, the game is practically finished and might have minor flaws.
      Due to this, the development teams behind the game are continuing to
      improve it and bring more details. While this is going on, testers are
      collecting the initial feedback from real users to give back to developers
      to make any important changes.

    <h2>What Happens Next - Post Production</h2>
    <p>
      After a game is launched, studios need to be monitoring their games to
      make sure their games continue to have a certain level of security and
      performance. Typically, studios will regularly release updates to meet the
      technical requirements of their chosen platform. Many companies also
      continue to support their games with in-game content updates to keep the
      game fresh and keep their users engaged in their game.
