    <h4>
      Many games start out looking nothing like their final designs. Designing and
      creating a finished mechanic that isn&#39t fun takes a lot of time and money.
      To avoid this, developers and studios create quick and unpolished prototypes
      to test if a mechanic is fun, if the user experience is good, if the art
      direction is good and so much more.

    <h3>How to create a quick prototype?</h3>
    <p>
      Prototyping can be an art in itself and there is no one way that fits all to
      create a prototype. However here are some suggestions on how to create a
      prototype:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using Paper &#38 Pencil for Prototyping<br />
          Paper prototypes are quick and easy to make, need no technical skills,
          and are easy to evaluate and change if something doesn't feel right. An
          example of a paper prototype can be drawing out levels and using dice
          for any randomness that the game may occur.

        <p>
          Using simple game engines <br />
          Game Engines such as Construct 3 or Clickteam Fusion 2.5 can cut down
          prototype development time and can help in creating prototypes because
          they offer many tools to rapidly test ideas, unlike complex game engines
          such as Unity, which require a lot more code to produce similar results.
