              Definition: the maintenance of a desired level of quality in a

              stage of the process of delivery or production

      <h2>What does this actually mean?</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of game development, Quality Assurance, or QA, is just testing
        the game. It's the process of playing the game and finding any issues,
        or bugs, with gameplay, artwork, the user interfaces, or anything else
        within the game. There are primarily 2 types of testing when playing a
        game, functional testing, and non-functional testing.

            <td>
              <h3>Functional Testing</h3>
              <p>
                Functional Testing is used to determine whether the game is
                functional according to the specifications
              </p>
              <p>These can involve but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Interoperability Testing</u> - Testing how a game interacts
                  with other applications
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Regression Testing</u> - Testing to make sure that the game
                  still works after any major code updates
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Smoke Testing</u> - Testing to make sure that the code is
                  stable after any code updates
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>User Acceptance Testing</u> - Can sometimes be considered a
                  beta test. This is used to polish the game and fix any
                  remaining minor bugs
                </li>
              </ul>

            <td>
              <h3>Non-Functional Testing</h3>
              <p>
                Non-Functional Testing is used to test for aspects of the game
                outside of making sure the game runs and is functioning properly
              </p>
              <p>These can involve but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Performance Testing</u> - Testing how well the game runs
                  and if it is running at the correct frame rate, how much
                  battery the game uses, and how much memory it is using.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Load Game Testing</u> - Testing how well the game runs when
                  pushing the game to its absolute limits and recording what
                  happens when the game breaks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Stress Game Testing</u> - Testing how well the game runs
                  when pushing the game to its absolute limits sporadically
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Usability Game Testing</u> - Testing to make sure the game
                  is fun and enjoyable for the player
                </li>
